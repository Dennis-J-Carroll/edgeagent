“Autonomic Edge”
Self-Optimizing Network Agents for Mission-Critical Environments

🧬 Ideal Landing Page — Full Breakdown (Extreme Detail)

🔝 
1. Hero Section (First Fold)
Headline (Positioning Statement):
Real-time, self-optimizing edge routers.
Powered by eBPF. Tuned by AI. Proven in healthcare, defense, and remote ops.
Subheadline (Value Prop):
Replace reactive firewalls, static QoS, and human-tweaked routing with autonomous dataplane agents that evolve in real-time to meet your SLOs.
Call to Action (CTA):
🟢 Button: “Request a Demo”


⚪ Secondary: “See Live Metrics” → opens Grafana demo link


Background Visual (non-glossy):
3D mesh or flow-diagram animation showing:


Nodes exchanging packets


AI loop adapting policies


Metrics flowing into dashboards



🛡 
2. Core Value Pillars (3 cards)
Each card is visually clickable, scrolls in with animation, and opens a modal with tech depth:
🧠 Autonomic Packet Intelligence
Real-time control loop over XDP


Fitness-based mutation of routing, filtering, and mirroring


Deploys without kernel patching or reboot


🔬 Deep Observability Built-In
eBPF map metrics streamed via Cloudflare exporter to Prometheus


Grafana dashboards expose latency, drops, throughput, fitness curves


Correlates protocol behavior with objective performance


🧪 Simulation-Grade Confidence
Labs validated in GNS3 & namespaces with traffic injectors (HL7, FHIR, RTP)


Failure injection, latency shaping, link saturation included


Compare “static config” vs “learned behavior” performance



🧭 
3. Live Demo Pane (Interactive Frame)
Split screen:
📈 Left: Live Grafana Dashboard Embed
Tabs: “Packet Flow,” “Fitness Evolution,” “Latency Budget”


Real Prometheus data (or pre-recorded demo using timeshifted playback)


📊 Right: Mutation Log Console
Text stream of GA activity:

4. Use Case Grid: Show Real Scenarios
6 Cards (clickable):


Use Case
Description
🏥 Remote Clinic Optimizer
Learns how to prioritize FHIR + PACS over VoIP + admin traffic
🛡 DDoS Frontline Agent
Drops junk traffic in microseconds at ingress, evolves filters during attack
🛰 Military/Edge Deployments
Tunnels around degraded links, rewrites routing on-site, no human in loop
🧬 Autonomous Factory Sites
Real-time RTSP/UDP flows prioritized under load without cloud dependency
🧵 Multi-tenant Edge Gateway
3-node namespace swarm auto-balances TCP drops by tenant latency targets
📉 Cost-Driven CDN Tuning
Reroutes packets based on egress cost, learned from live billing metrics

🧬 
5. How It Works (Tech-Driven Walkthrough)
A 4-step visualization scroll panel:
🧱 eBPF/XDP loads at NIC ingress


CO-RE XDP program inspects, classifies, drops/mirrors/redirects


📊 Maps export metrics


Per-CPU verdict counts, latency buckets


🧠 Genetic Optimizer runs


NSGA-III evolves config across latency, drops, cost, energy


📈 Dashboards update in real-time


Live fitness frontier + packet telemetry


Footnote:
“No kernel modules, no reboot. Only libbpf, bpftool, and Prometheus.”

6. Developer Mode (Link to GitHub/Docs)
SEC("xdp")
int adaptive_guard(struct xdp_md *ctx) {
    struct xdp_policy *p = bpf_map_lookup_elem(&policy, &zero);
    if (p && p->drop_udp_port && udp->dest == p->drop_udp_port)
        return XDP_DROP;
    return XDP_PASS;
}
# NSGA-III evolution: minimize p95 latency and drop ratio
pop = toolbox.population(n=50)
for gen in range(NGEN):
    mutate(pop); evaluate(pop); update_metrics(); select()

7. Social Proof / Case Studies
2–3 featured logos or testimonials:
💬 “We reduced average packet delay from 38ms to 11ms with zero manual tuning. Autonomic Edge transformed our remote diagnostics network.”
— CTO, VitalPath Healthcare
💬 “It’s like having an AI co-pilot for my network. The GA learns what works better than I ever could in real time.”
— Edge Infrastructure Lead, GovNet
