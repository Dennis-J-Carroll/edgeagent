# EdgeAgent experimental sandbox

This branch hosts an experimental version of the EdgeAgent project. It’s a scratchpad for prototyping new ideas, exploring API integrations, and testing out‑of‑the‑box features. The code and assets here may be incomplete, unpolished and occasionally broken.

Feel free to browse and get inspired by the experiments, but note that the polished and production‑ready projects live in other repositories, such as [`edge_dynamics`](https://github.com/Dennis-J-Carroll/edge_dynamics) and [`telco‑churn‑analysis`](https://github.com/Dennis-J-Carroll/telco-churn-analysis). This branch is intentionally separate so the main portfolio remains clean while still showcasing curiosity and a willingness to tinker.
